_Financial metrics dashboard with a React + TypeScript frontend and a FastAPI backend._

## Recommended steps

1. Fork this repository to your account.
2. Clone your fork and open the project in your editor.
3. Run your AI agent to inspect both frontend and backend.
4. Document the proposed rules and memory bank in your fork.
5. Refine and validate the rules until they fit the project's real workflow.

## Expected agents directory structure

```text
./.agents
└─ /rules
   └─ <rule-name>.md
└─ /skills
   └─ /<skill-name>
      └─ /SKILL.md
```

## How to run locally

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend: http://localhost:8000
- API documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

The dashboard requests `/api/metrics` from the frontend origin. Vite proxies
`/api` to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` when running locally, or to
`http://backend:8000` in Docker Compose via `API_PROXY_TARGET`. No environment
file is required for Compose. In Codespaces, open the forwarded frontend port
5173, not the backend root URL (which returns 404).

For a separate API deployment, set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to its origin (for example,
`https://api.example.com`), without `/api`, and configure backend CORS for the
frontend origin. Restart Vite after changing environment variables. A production
static host must proxy `/api` to the backend or use this explicit API origin;
the Vite development proxy is not included in the build.
